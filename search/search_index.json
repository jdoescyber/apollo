We'll be using a free (and open source) application to delete junk and temporary files from the file system.</p> <p>Navigate to Bleachbit's Website and download whichever edition you prefer. If you aren't sure, the <code>installer .exe</code> file will likely be best for you. Install the application as you normally would any other, and then run Bleachbit as an administrator. It usually takes around 15-20 seconds to open because it's doing some system application discovery and calculations in the background.</p> <p>Clicking an option on the left will provide you with a brief description on the right.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The listed applications on the left-side pane will vary by person to person.
